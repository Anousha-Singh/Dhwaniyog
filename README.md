## Project Overview

This project aims to digitize the clinical services for speech language therapy to streamline operations and improve efficiency. The current manual system faces challenges due to high therapy case loads and a limited number of therapy supervisors, leading to delays in service provision. Our solution will automate the entire workflow from patient allocation to clinical evaluation.

## Features

- **Patient Allocation**: Automatically assign patients to available therapists.
- **Therapy Plan Documentation**: Therapists can create and document therapy plans with goals and activities.
- **Supervisor Review**: Supervisors review and provide inputs on therapy plans.
- **Progress Reports**: Therapists write progress reports after at least ten therapy sessions.
- **Evaluation and Feedback**: Supervisors evaluate progress reports and provide feedback.
- **Clinical Ratings**: Supervisors give clinical ratings based on the overall handling of therapy sessions.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The system supports ongoing management of therapy cases until completion or discontinuation.

## Workflow

1. **Patient Allocation**: Patients are assigned to therapists based on availability.
2. **Therapy Plan Creation**: Therapists prepare detailed therapy plans including goals and activities.
3. **Supervisor Review**: Supervisors review the therapy plans and provide feedback for further action.
4. **Progress Reporting**: After a minimum of ten sessions, therapists write progress reports.
5. **Progress Evaluation**: Supervisors evaluate the progress reports and provide additional feedback.
6. **Clinical Ratings**: Supervisors assess the overall management of therapy cases and assign clinical ratings.
7. **Continuous Cycle**: The process continues until the therapy case is either resolved or discontinued.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Reduces manual paperwork and accelerates the therapy process.
- **Accuracy**: Minimizes errors in documentation and reporting.
- **Accessibility**: Provides easy access to patient records and therapy plans.
- **Feedback Loop**: Enhances communication between therapists and supervisors.
